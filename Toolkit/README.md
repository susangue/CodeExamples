<h1>Background</h1>

<p>This project was the first design and development project in 2011 where I needed to incorporate as much 508 Accessibility practices that I was familiar with. Usage of ARIA was still foreign to the development world and only minimally broswer supported. As you can tell from this simplistic code and long css file, the structure needed to be clean.</p>
<p>Achieving the client request for a vertical layout and quick points of reference was successfully executed utilizing graphical elements such as double borders, document icons indicating type of link reference, even the solid background in the left column under the secondary navigation.</p>
<p>As lead developer creating a total of seven toolkits all with this same base layout, each had to look different while marrying the visual system.<p>
<p>Although this project is developed using very basic technology, I achieved clean, usable code that is utilitarian.</p>
