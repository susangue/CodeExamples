          <p>It is vital that you are able to recognize change, or potential change, in order to identify and anticipate scientific information and data that you may need to acquire in order to answer important management questions and make decisions in the future.</p>
          <p>Agents of change can:</p>
          <ul class="list--sm">
            <li class="list__item">Be biological, physical, or human-related</li>
            <li class="list__item">Be fast or slow</li>
            <li class="list__item">Be large or small</li>
            <li class="list__item">Cause modifications that affect all park resources and operations</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Having a plan in place that outlines anticipated change and options for action when change occurs can help reduce the impact of adverse change events on park resources.</p>

          <p class="header-sub-green">Biological Change</p>
            <p>Animals and plants can cause changes to park systems and resources. For example, land adjacent to a new beaver impoundment can be inundated in a matter of weeks. Water may cover large areas where topography is flat. The dam will change the hydrology of the water system, increasing the amount of still water and water level fluctuations.</p>
            <p>Changed habitats will likely impact the species composition in the area. Water may flood critical park infrastructure or saturate soils and change soil stability.</p>
            <p>Management actions responding to these types of changes will vary based on the resources impacted. A park with forest resources bordering watersheds in beaver-prone areas could use floodplain analysis to identify areas that might be threatened by new beaver activity.</p>

            <p class="header-sub-green">Physical Change</p>
            <p>Changes to the physical environment may be caused by events such as storms, earthquakes, or erosion.</p>
            <p>A landslide is a physical change that can significantly impact park resources. Landslides can cause immediate infrastructure damage and casualties, but they can also produce long-term environmental changes.</p>
            <p>For instance, a landslide into a valley may create a dam with an upstream impoundment, reducing water flow to habitats below. Where sensitive resources are found in potential slide zones, planning can assess vulnerability and recovery potential after a landslide.</p>
            <p>In the future, precipitation patterns are forecast to change from historical norms in many areas, and this may influence the probability and scale of physical changes.</p>

            <p class="header-sub-green">Human-induced Change</p>
            <p>Human-induced change can occur on a variety of scales, from off-trail ORVs impacting vegetation in a single park meadow to issues like air pollution and climate change impacting resources on a regional or global scale.</p>
            <p>In contrast to most biological and physical changes, some human-induced change can be managed in the planning process rather than through reactive management. For instance, when planning park facilities, natural resource inventories can help to reduce the impact of new development.</p>
