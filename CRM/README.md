Using Adobe Flex Builder to write and generate the output source code, this CRM/UD project is built completely custom from the ground up. Applying XML code to refer to the content and talk with Flex for accurate javascript calls. ActionScript is used in this project to call each interaction, module, and include into the appropriate page at just the right time. The Javascript files were utilized to apply each interactive item on stage, including placement in the course GUI, and graphical elements including most styles.

Although this type of development is no longer utilized, this demonstrates how diverse my skill with code can be and how far the developing technology has come.
