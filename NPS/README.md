<h1>Background</h1>

<p>With Foundation as the base responsive framework, I utilized partials and layouts in this porject achieving quick inclusion into muliple files when needed. Frontmatter in each files is created for, what I like to call, quick parts. Handlebars is primarily used resulting in condusive and clean code.</p>
<p>The stacked book interaction uses a standard left tab interaction format with added movement giving the impression of a book pulled out from a stack of books. This movement of elements provides a fun visual indication of the users selection, opposed to just changing out the background color or adding an icon next to the book title.</p>
<p>The image tab interaction also uses the same tab interaction base code with customized sass implemetation.</p>
<p>Holding a lead role in functional design execution, GUI development, and interaction execution, this project quickly proved my rapid coherence with ever evolving technological cycles.</p>
