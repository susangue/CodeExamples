          <p>Strategic plans provide consistency across parks that are managing resources amid change. These strategies are applicable to all science-based decision making, resource, and park planning actions. You will find links to these documents in the Reference document on the Resources tab.</p>
          <p>When examining strategic plans, think about the following questions:</p>
          <ul class="list--sm">
            <li class="list__item">How do they address anticipated or unexpected changes in resource conditions?</li>
            <li class="list__item">Do they allow the NPS flexibility to respond to change? If so, how much latitude is given?</li>
            <li class="list__item">Do they utilize the concept of adaptive management?</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="header-sub-green">National Park Service Natural Resource Stewardship and Science Framework (2016)</p>
          <p>In Topic 1 we briefly touched on this framework that identifies four pillars that guide the NPS to adapt and respond to continuous change. Each pillar includes focus areas.</p>
          <p>The focus areas for managing amid continuous change include:</p>
          <ul class="list--sm">
            <li class="list__item">Promote Restoration that Builds Long-term Adaptive Capacity</li>
            <li class="list__item">Understand and Develop Mitigation Measures for Resolving Stressors Related to Land-Use Change</li>
            <li class="list__item">Plan for and Respond to Climate Change</li>
            <li class="list__item">Anticipate and Address Emerging Issues</li>
            <li class="list__item">Understand and Respond to Changing Socioeconomic Characteristics and Cultural Values that are Relevant to the NPS Mission</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="header-sub-green">Science Communication Framework (2016)</p>
          <p>Science communication is a core function of park science and resource stewardship employees, particularly in an era of rapid change. This framework provides a guide to help a wide variety of users develop science communication products, practices, programs, and structures.</p>
          <p>Guiding principles include:</p>
            <ul class="list--sm">
              <li class="list__item">Presentation of accurate and current knowledge </li>
              <li class="list__item">Fostering learning</li>

          <p class="header-sub-green">National Park Service Climate Change Response Strategy (2010)</p>
          <p>The NPS Climate Change Response Strategy provides direction to address the impacts of climate change. Its goals and objectives fall under four integrated components:</p>
          <ul class="list--sm">
            <li class="list__item"><strong>Science</strong>: Collaborate with partners to identify and monitor climate change effects in parks and to apply accurate and relevant science to management and policy decisions</li>
            <li class="list__item"><strong>Adaptation</strong>: Develop feasible and actionable scenarios and create a flexible framework for dealing with impacts</li>
            <li class="list__item"><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Reduce the National Park Service’s carbon footprint through energy-efficient and sustainable practices and integrate these practices into planning and op­erations </li>
            <li class="list__item"><strong>Communication</strong>: Raise employees’ and the public’s awareness of the implications of climate change and inspire them to take steps to address this challenge</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="header-sub-green">National Park Service Coastal Adaptations Strategy Handbook (2016)</p>
          <p>This handbook summarizes the current state of NPS climate adaptation and key approaches currently in practice or considered for climate change adaptation in coastal areas. The handbook:</p>
          <ul class="list--sm">
            <li class="list__item">Identifies tools and strategies</li>
            <li class="list__item">Provides examples of approaches that the agency and individual parks are using to address coastal vulnerabilities and climate change impacts </li>
            <li class="list__item">Provides policy and decision-making guidelines  </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="header-sub-green">Other Federal, State, and Local Documents</p>
          <p>Depending on your job and the resources you are working with, you may need to be aware of other strategic planning documents such as:</p>
          <ul class="list--sm">
            <li class="list__item">State air quality plans</li>
            <li class="list__item">State comprehensive and issue-specific wildlife plans (e.g. chronic wasting disease, hunting regulations on adjacent or state land)</li>
            <li class="list__item">Interagency exotic and pest management plans (e.g. gypsy moth, emerald ash borer, bark beetles)</li>
            <li class="list__item">National Park Service issue decision documents (deer management, winter use, chronic wasting disease, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These types of documents may influence NPS decisions and planning. Being aware of plans that extend beyond park boundaries can foster better coordination, collaboration and anticipation of future changing conditions.</p>
